What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I think I just got very confused and frustrated in the beginning that it made me not want to do the work at all. I could not understand it by myself in the beginning but I think asking a person in class next to you was helpful. Advice I would give is to go to TA hours right away as soon as you get the assignment, even if you don't think you'll need it.
